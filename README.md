short script to check available VPNs on vpngate.net
and parse the desired vpn.

Install/Usage:

  If you do not have a home bin directory,

  mkdir ~/bin; cp ./opengate.py ~/bin/opengate; chmod 700 ~/bin/opengate

  Otherwise, simply move the script into your bin directory.

  If you have not added your home directory to $PATH, append the
  following to your .bashrc or .profile,

  PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"

  Simplified:
  run  ./install.sh
